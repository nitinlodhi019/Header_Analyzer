## CSV Header Description Generator

This script uses a pre-trained open-source language model to automatically generate short, descriptive explanations for column headers found in a CSV file. It serves as a simple tool for quick data documentation and to gain an initial understanding of a dataset's structure.

## Model Selection

For this task, I chose the gpt2 model from Hugging Face. The primary requirement is to generate descriptive text, and GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) is designed specifically for this purpose. It is a well-established and relatively small model (approx. 500MB), which makes it feasible to download and run on a standard local machine without specialized hardware, aligning perfectly with the "offline / open-source" guideline. Through careful prompt engineering and output processing, it can deliver concise and useful results for this specific assignment.

## How to Run Your Script

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Set up a virtual environment and install the required packages.
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
# Install libraries
pip install transformers torch
```

3. **Execute the Script:** Run the script from your terminal, passing the path to your CSV file (e.g., input.csv) as a command-line argument.
```
python csv_header_analyzer.py input.csv
```

4. **View Output:** The script will print results to the console and save them in a file named output.txt.

## Challenges Faced

A key challenge was controlling the model's verbosity and relevance. By default, GPT-2 can produce long or repetitive text. To address this, I implemented several strategies: I engineered a specific prompt to instruct the model on the desired output, I tuned generation parameters like max_length and no_repeat_ngram_size to keep the output concise, and I added a post-processing step to clean the generated text and truncate it to a single, clear sentence.
