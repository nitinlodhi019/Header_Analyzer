CSV Header Description Generator
This script uses a pre-trained open-source language model to automatically generate short, descriptive explanations for column headers found in a CSV file. It serves as a simple tool for quick data documentation and to gain an initial understanding of a dataset's structure.

Model Selection
For this task, I chose the gpt2 model from Hugging Face. Here's the reasoning:

Generative Nature: The primary requirement is to generate descriptive text. GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) is designed specifically for this purpose. It excels at completing sentences and generating human-like text based on a given prompt, making it a perfect fit for explaining what a header "means".

Accessibility & Size: gpt2 is a well-established and relatively small model (approx. 500MB). This makes it feasible to download and run on a standard local machine without requiring specialized hardware (like a high-end GPU), aligning perfectly with the "offline / open-source" guideline.

Performance: While not as powerful as its larger successors, gpt2 is more than capable of providing coherent, contextually relevant descriptions for common data headers. Through careful prompt engineering and output processing, it can deliver concise and useful results for this specific assignment.

How to Run Your Script
Follow these steps to run the script:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed on your system.

Install Dependencies: You will need the transformers library from Hugging Face and a deep learning framework like torch. You can install them using pip:

pip install transformers torch

Note: The first time you run the script, it will download the gpt2 model files (approx. 500MB), which requires an internet connection. All subsequent runs will use the cached files and will be completely offline.

Prepare Input CSV: Create a CSV file with the headers you want to analyze. For example, you can use the provided input.csv file, which contains:

Invoice_ID,Vendor_Name,Amount,Payment_Date

Execute the Script: Run the script from your terminal, passing the path to your CSV file as a command-line argument.

python csv_header_analyzer.py input.csv

View Output: The script will first print its progress, then the final results to the console. It will also save the same output in a file named output.txt in the same directory.

Challenges Faced
A key challenge was controlling the model's verbosity and relevance. By default, a generative model like GPT-2 can produce long, rambling, or sometimes nonsensical text. To address this, I implemented several strategies in the generate_description function:

Prompt Engineering: I created a very specific prompt (f"In a data file, the column header '{header}' means") to clearly instruct the model on the desired output. I also replaced underscores with spaces in the header to make it more natural for the model to process.

Parameter Tuning: In the model.generate() call, I used parameters like max_length, no_repeat_ngram_size, and early_stopping to keep the output concise, prevent the model from repeating itself, and stop it from writing unnecessarily long sentences.

Output Post-processing: After the model generates the text, the script performs additional cleaning. It strips the original prompt from the output and truncates the description to the first sentence, ensuring the final text is short, clean, and directly addresses the task's requirements.
